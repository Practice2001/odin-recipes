    <h1>Chocolate Milk</h1>
    <img src="../images/chocolate-milk.jpg">
    <p>Chocolate milk is easy to make at home from scratch, and you don't need a bottle of chocolate syrup. This recipe is made with real cocoa powder and just a little sugar for sweetness. Both kids and adults are going to love its taste. Unlike powdered chocolate milk mixes that are filled with preservatives and hard-to-pronounce ingredients, you only need three simple ingredients for this chocolate milk recipe. You have total control over what goes into your milk. Every aspect of this recipe can be customized. For instance, use your favorite type of milk, whether it's dairy or an alternative like almond or soy milk. By using unsweetened cocoa powder, you can adjust the sweetness to taste with more or less sugar. It's also easy to scale it up for a big, ready-to-drink batch in the fridge. You can even warm it up for hot cocoa or add a little extra flavor.</p>
